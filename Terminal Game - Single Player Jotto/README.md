Single player jotto terminal game

The computer picks a secret five letter word from a list. No proper nouns are used. The object of the game is to correctly guess the secret word.

The player guesses some five-letter word, and the computer announces how many letters in that guess match a unique letter in their secret word. For example, if the secret word is OTHER and the guess is PEACH, the E and H in PEACH match an E and an H in OTHER, so the announced result is "2". (Letters don't need to occur in the same position.)

The game keeps track of each guess and result. If a guess has a score of zero, those letters will be annotated as not being part of the secret. The score is added to each letter in a guess and the top ten letters are displayed

Once the player guesses the word, the computer will issue a game score for the player
