single player jotto terminal game

The computer picks a secret five letter word from a list. No proper nouns are used. The object of the game is to correctly guess the other player's word first.

The player guesses some five-letter word, and the computer announces how many letters in that guess match a unique letter in their secret word. For example, if the secret word is OTHER and the guess is PEACH, the E and H in PEACH match an E and an H in OTHER, so the announced result is "2". (Letters don't need to occur in the same position.)

The game keeps track of each guess and result, crossing out letters of the alphabet that (by deduction) cannot appear in the secret word.

Once the player guesses the word, the computer will issue a score for the player
